In this paper, we create a computer program (a bot) that excels at Rock, Paper, Scissors. After studying literature on this topic and testing different strategies, we ultimately create a bot using two strategies: recognizing patterns in previous move sequences and using an updating frequency analysis. These strategies lead to more victories than previous strategies we used on our test bots. Our bot performs very well against test bots, and we are hopeful that it will continue to perform well in the final tournament. In future work, we would like to build on our current strategy and add a component in which the bot recognizes when it is losing and changes strategies. We would also like to test some sort of human-like component where the bot second-guesses itself or thinks like a human in terms of psychology and believing it can out-smart its opponent.
