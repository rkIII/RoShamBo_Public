In this experiment, we create a computer program (i.e. a bot) to excel at Rock, Paper, Scissors (RoShamBo). Our goal is to beat other bots playing non-equilibrium strategies. We design a bot that attempts to exploit its opponents' own strategies, which we assume. Our bot recognizes patterns in opponents' moves and also makes moves based on the probabilities of the opponents' actions. We find that our bot performs well against other test bots, including ones that use complex strategies like our own.
